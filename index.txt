Stream:
- Ways to perform identical operations on collections (ArrayList, List, Collections)
- Multiply every index buy 2
- Find all even numbers / add together all even numbers

Annotations:
- Enhanced comments for code

Generics:
- Passing in variable type to methods/classes
- Classes you need to specify what type (ArrayList<>)
- Methods the type is figured out automatically

Interfaces:
- commonly used in Streams
- excessive use of lambdas
- seemingly useless for "standard use" main use is as method parameters or Streams

Multithreading
- concurrent code execution
